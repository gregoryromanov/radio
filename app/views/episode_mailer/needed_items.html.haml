Here is a reminder with the show information and the list of needed items.

I usually like to work on the script for the show on Wednesday Night, so if you could get the small list of things I need these from you by the close of business on the Wednesday before the show that would be wonderful.

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Thanks!
